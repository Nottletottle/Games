# Game Projects

Welcome to my collection of small game projects! ðŸŽ®

## Overview

This repository contains two classic games I've built in Python using Pygame to practice my algorithms and coding skills:

1. **Minesweeper**: The classic puzzle game where you uncover tiles on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. You can play it solo, but if you're in doubt, you can get assistance from AI to make the best possible move. I've implemented AI using techniques from propositional logic, inference, and knowledge engineering. ðŸ¤– Test your strategy and luck!
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A two-player game where you aim to get three of your marks in a row. I've implemented a smart AI using the minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Minesweeper**: 
  - Click on tiles to reveal them.
  - Flag suspected mines.
  - Win by uncovering all safe tiles!
  - Get AI assistance for optimal moves when you're unsure.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**:
  - Play against a challenging AI.
  - AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
  - Includes a simple and clean user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
- Install Pygame if you haven't already:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
